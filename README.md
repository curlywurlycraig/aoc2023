Advent of Code, 2023.

I'm using Lua for this because both the Playdate and neovim use Lua. Seems both
an interesting language with interesting choices, and easy to learn. Plus the
simplicity and expressiveness of it seems well suited to AoC type problems.

The code is probably not great though, since I rush these out in the mornings
usually.
